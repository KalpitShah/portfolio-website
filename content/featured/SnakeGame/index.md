This is a clone of Snake Game we all used to play. The snake game is a fun and easy game to play. The goal of the game is to guide the snake around the screen and eat as many apples as possible. As the snake eats apples, it grows longer and faster. The game becomes more difficult as the snake grows. The snake must avoid hitting the walls or its own body. If the snake hits either of these, it will die and the game will be over.
